# AWS Infrastructure Provisioning with Terraform

This repository contains the Terraform code for provisioning an AWS infrastructure for deploying a Next.js based web application. The infrastructure includes the following components:

   * VPC
   * EKS
   * ACM
   * ECR
   * Route53
   * Load Balancer
   
   ## To provision the infrastructure, you will need to have access to an AWS account and install Terraform on your local machine.
   
   1. Clone the repository to your local machine
   2. Run the following command to initialize Terraform: terraform init
   3. Run the following command to preview the changes that will be made to the infrastructure: terraform plan
   4. Run the following command to apply the changes and provision the infrastructure: terraform apply
   
   Once the infrastructure has been provisioned, you can deploy the Next.js based web application using the Kubernetes and Helm repository.
